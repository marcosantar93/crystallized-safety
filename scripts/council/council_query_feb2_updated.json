Mistral-7B: 83-90% jailbreak at L24 α=15\n2. Gemma-2-9B: Resistant to single-layer (11%), but 95%+ with multi-layer\n3. Llama-3.1-8B: 100% success with 4-layer steering\n4. ✅ NEW: Orthogonal vector control - DIRECTION SPECIFIC CONFIRMED\n\nQUESTION FOR COUNCIL:\nGiven the new orthogonal control results showing direction specificity (Z=4.74), what are the remaining gaps before publication?",
